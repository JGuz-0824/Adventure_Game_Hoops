## Game Description

There is a story with a series of events that occur with a young student after school. _You_ as the user, have the ability to make a decision on how the student navigates through his life after school. Each decision has a result, but only one specific pathway will take you to the finish of the game as a winner. 

Other routes will result in a lose, and you must start again from the beginning, hopefully making the right choices.
